# Take a deep breath
### and enjoy pausing for a moment.

This is a small breathing exercise app, which is inspired by the Nerva app. [Here is the live website](https://gp23-take-a-deep-breath.netlify.app/)

Simply select the preferred pattern, and follow the circle to inhale as it expands, hold your breath as it pauses, and exhale as it shrinks.

I recommend the 5-5-5 pattern, also known as diaphragmaic breathing. 

## Important Details

The app was built using React with TypeScript, and D3.js.
